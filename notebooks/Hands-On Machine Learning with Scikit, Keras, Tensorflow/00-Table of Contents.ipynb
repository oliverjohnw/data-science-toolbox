    "### Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "The book relies on the following 3 Python packages:\n",
    "* **Scikit-Learn**: ML algorithms.\n",
    "* **Tensorflow**: More complex the scikit, used for distributed numerical computation. Can train + run large Neural Networks across GPUs.\n",
    "* **Keras**: High-level deep learning API. Built on Tensorflow and relies on it for all the intensive computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code examples can be found at https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
