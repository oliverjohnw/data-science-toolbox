    "# Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter runs through an example project. Specifically, this chapter will use data about California housing prices. The main steps that they walk through are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Look at the big picture.\n",
    "2) Get the data.\n",
    "3) Explore and visualize the data to gain insight.\n",
    "4) Prepare the data for ML algorithms\n",
    "5) Select a model and train it.\n",
    "6) Fine tune your model.\n",
    "7) Present your solution.\n",
    "8) Launch, monitor, and maintain your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Look at the Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we use data from the California census. Our task is to use this data to build a model of housing prices in the state. The data includes metrics such as population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California (\"districts\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we will want to do, is look at Appendix A - our machine learning project checklist. This can be seen in the `Appendix A - Machine Learning Checklist.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frame the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is to ask the boss *what exactly the business objective is*. Building a model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model? \n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is to ask the boss *what current solutions look like (if any)*. This can give a reference for performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once these questions are asked and answered, we can figure out the following:\n",
    "* Are we looking for a supervised, unsupervised, or other type of system?\n",
    "* Is it a classification task or regression? What's the response?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example in this chapter, we will be using a supervised regression system, as our target is median housing price - which is a continous variable. We could bin these values and make it a classification task, but we will treat it as regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Select a Performance Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting a performance measure, we can determine how well our system generates predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For regression, common metrics are:\n",
    "* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "* Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "* R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)\n",
    "* Adjusted R-Squared\n",
    "* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)\n",
    "* AIC/BIC\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, common metrics are:\n",
    "* Accuracy\n",
    "* Precision\n",
    "* Recall\n",
    "* F1 Score\n",
    "* Specificity\n",
    "* Sensitivity\n",
    "* ROC/AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "A more indepth explanation for these can be found in the `docs/performance_measures.docx` file. In this problem, we elect to use RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check the Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore + Visualize Data to Gain Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare the Data for Machine Learning ALgorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Select and Train a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fine-Tune Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System\n"
