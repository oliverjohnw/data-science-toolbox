# Data Science Toolbox

Welcome to my **Data Science Toolbox** repository! This repository is a personal collection of notes, code snippets, and resources that I've accumulated over time from books, articles, and projects. It's largely designed as a reference for myself, but others who might find these resources useful in their data science journey are free to use as well.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Additional documentation.
  - `Machine Learning Checklist.docx`: Checklist for new ML projects.
  - `Performance Metrics.docx`: Performance metrics for ML models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks.
  - `Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit, Keras, Tensorflow`: Notes for Hands-ON ML book by Aurelien Geron.
- `.gitignore`: Gitignore file.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: Package dependencies.

## Book Notes

Each book that I read will receive its own folder in the `notebooks/` folder. My goal is to provide a unique notebook for each chapter in the book. In addition to the notebooks created, there may also be documentation (which is stored in the `docs/` folder), data (which is stored in the `data/` folder), and source code (which is stored in the `src`) folder.

This repository contains notes for the following books:
* Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow - Aurelien Geron (2023)

## Documentation

As mentioned in the section above, any additional documentation that I've gathered will be stored in the `docs/` folder.

This repository contains the following documentation:
* **Machine Learning Checklist**: A checklist that can be used at the start of a new ML project.
* **Performance Metrics**: Definition and examples of performance metrics that are used to quantify goodness-of-fit in ML models.
